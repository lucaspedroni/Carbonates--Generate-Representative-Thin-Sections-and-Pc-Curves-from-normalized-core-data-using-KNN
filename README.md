# Generate-Core-Calibrated-Thin-Sections-and-Pc-Curves-from-normalized-core-data-using-KNN
This repository utilizes normalized core data with distance-weighted estimations for only the KNN samples being considered. This program queries a published carbonate core analysis database having Thomeer Capillary Pressure parameters and another with links to available Thin Sections to generate a widget showing both an estimated Capillary Pressure curve and representative Thin Sections for any reasonable user defined Porosity vs. Permeability combination for this particular reservoir. The results are based entirely on the core data being employed that represents this Arab D carbonate reservoir.
